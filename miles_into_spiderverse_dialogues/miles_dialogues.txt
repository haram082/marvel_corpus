Yeah?!--

Yeah! Just ironing my last shirt!

Where’s my laptop?RIO ¿Donde le dejaste?

¡Yo no se!

(edging away)

(continuing) --It’s ok--

(chewing) In a minute!

Mom. I gotta go...

Okay, mami. Hasta luego!

--Hey, I’m just walking by, how you doing?-- 4.

--Seguro que si--

What are you talking about? I slept like a baby last night.

You miss me? I still live here! Wait, you miss me?

¡Contra!

(knows what’s coming) Ah c’mon...

Seriously, Dad, walking would have been fine.

You saw that? I don’t know if that was me, Dad.

Yeah. Those were me.

Totally, yeah...

Foam Party.

Dad, you’re old, man.

Yeah, Dad.

That’s not even how the saying goes, Dad--

(mortified) --Oh my gosh. Don’t cops run red lights?

Why can’t I go back to Brooklyn Middle?

--I just think that this new school is elitist--

--and I would prefer to be at a normal school among the people.

--I'm only here ‘cause I won that stupid lottery--

(under his breath) --What’s wrong with Uncle Aaron? He’s a good guy--

--It doesn't feel like I have a choice right now--

Yeah, I know, Dad. See you Friday--

Dad, I love you.

Hey good morning. How you doing?... Weekend was short, huh? (he turns to another kid) Oh my gosh this is embarrassing, we wore the same jacket--

Yeah, I’m aware. It’s a choice.

Einstein said time was relative, right? Maybe I’m not late. Maybe you guys are early.

Really?

(taken aback, then) I don’t think I’ve seen you before--

A zero? A few more of those and you probably have to kick me outta here huh? Maybe I’m just not right for this school?

Fifty percent?

Wait wait!

(laughing) Uncle Aaroooooon! Hey! Were you scared?!

You want that, huh? Unh. Unh.

Going great. Got tons of friends.

No, there’s no one. There’s no one. Aaron walks over to the microwave to get some popcorn.

I got game! (fronting)

(stutters, until--) --You know we... this is... we’re laying down the ground work right now.

Of course I do! But tell me anyway.

(laughing) You serious Uncle Aaron?

So walk up to her and be like... hey.

"Hey."

(mocks him) Heyyyyy.

(checking his phone) I should probably go. Still got a paper to do tonight.

No, man, you know my dad. I can’t.

I can’t! I can’t I can’t--

I’m gonna get in so much trouble.

Hey, how did you know about this place?

Wassup? Uncle Aaron laughs.

Whoa... (then, for the echoes)

This is so fresh.

Little help?

That’s intentional!

(suddenly embarrassed) Is it too crazy?

That's weird. My pants shrank.

I think I hit puberty. Ganke stops typing at this laptop, eyes wide. He quickly

I gotta get new pants. Wait, why is the voice in my head so loud? (then) What--

What?

It's a puberty thing. I don't know why I said that. I’m not going through puberty. I did. But I’m done. (”cool” and deep voice) I’m a man. (tries to be suave) --So you're, like, new here, right? We got that in common.

Wait, your name is Gwanda?

Do the shoulder touch now! Before she walks away!

Why is this so scary? Am I doing this in slow motion or does it just feel that way?

(”cool” and deep voice) “Hey.”

Oh. See you.

Sorry... um... oh crap--

I'm working on it.  It's just puberty!

Nice to meet you. She won’t even look at him.

No one saw. It’s ok. No one knows. No one knows. (everyone is staring) Everyone knows. Everyone knows! 22.

They’re talking about me. They saw everything. He knows. She knows. They know.

You’re okay. You’re okay. You’re okay. He’ll never find you.

No.

Why is this happening?

(exerting himself) Stop... sticking!

My room!

(pure panic) How could there be two Spider-Men? There can’t be two Spider-Men.

Come on Uncle Aaron. Pick up. Pick up.

No nononono. It's not possible--

It's just puberty, it’s a normal spider, and I'm a normal kid--

I gotta tell someone. He scrolls to his DAD’s number. He thinks to himself for a

Find the spider. You’ll see.

It's a normal spider. It’s like boring how normal the spider is...

Slow down!/What am I doing? What am I doing?

Look out./I don’t want to be a hero!/Look out.

Whoa!

Spider-Man?!

Is that Green Goblin!?

I think I’m gonna go...

No, no!

Woah!!

What is this place?--

Uh huh.

I don’t want to be.

Yeah...

(so relieved) Yeah.

How does he do that?30.

I should go up there and help him! Who am I kidding, I should not do that.

Hey! Are you okay???

Can’t you get up?

--What?

I promise.

Stop sticking!

Can I sleep here tonight?

Dad?

...Do you really hate Spider-Man?

Mom, do you ever think about moving out of Brooklyn?

Yeah, I know.

Yeah.

Can I return it if it doesn’t fit?

(to himself) They’re counting on me. 41.

I’m sorry, Mr. Parker... That thing you gave me, that key... (holds it out) I think I really messed it up. I want to do what you asked. I really do, but... I’m sorry. I’m not sure I’m the guy. I can’t do this without you.

Woah!!

What did I do to him? Uh...

No... Who are you?43.

Who are you?

Are you kidding me right now?

--See ya, officers!--

--Oh come on--

Adios?

Help! Somebody stop that train!

Yes! I didn’t kill you!

Who are you?

Hey, uh, maybe you guys can go around? Alright. Thanks, New York. 49.

(tough voice) I got some questions.

Why do you look like Peter Parker?

Then why aren’t you dead? Why is your hair different? Why are you older, why is your body... a different shape?

No, no you just--

--Are you a ghost?--

--Are you a zombie?--

--Am I a zombie?--

Are you from another dimension? (Peter is quiet) Like a parallel universe where things are like this universe but different? And you're Spider-Man in that universe? But somehow traveled to this universe, but you don’t know how?

Well, we learned about it in physics.

(realizing) This is amazing. You can teach me just like Peter said he would--

Look I made a promise to him.

Peter, seriously--

Hey, are you okay?

What’s going on with your body?

With great power comes great--

I don’t have a choice. Kingpin’s got a supercollider. He’s trying to kill me.

Kingpin’s trying to kill me.

Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower.

Where are you going?

--You can’t let them run it. I’m supposed to destroy it so it never runs again or everyone’s gonna die--

Aren’t you going to need this?

(holding it back) Wait, no. Not so fast. He called it an override key.

I need it to destroy the collider.

(mouth full) No! I’ll swallow it, don’t play with me!

(mouth full) I said--

No, it... broke. I don’t remember what happened.

Can’t we make another one?

Look, if I don’t turn off the collider after you leave, everyone in this city, my parents, my uncle, and millions of others will die, and you’re just gonna go home and leave me here to figure this out for myself? You good with that, Spider-Man?

Making you feel guilty. Is it working?55.

Can we focus?

The other Peter--

The other Peter said he was going to be showing me the ropes.

You got any Spider-Man tips you can tell me now?

Anything else?

I think you’re going to be a bad teacher.

(reads from his phone) A private technological campus in Hudson Valley, New York. (excited) You can teach me to swing on the way there.

I think it’s cool.

So how do we retrace Peter’s steps?

That lady with the bike is the head scientist. I saw her in this documentary at school.

--It’s not technically hacking. It’s kinda--

Look, man you have to teach me to do Spider-Man stuff or I’m not going to be able to help--

(so mad) Why did I get stuck with the janky-old, broke, hobo Spider-Man?

That’s new. 59.

Kingpin! He hides behind the rock, thinking. What does he do? What does he do? What does he do?

(whispering) Peter! Peter--

Peter!

Kingpin’s here! Just move over!

Move a little to your right--

No, I can’t sit there and just let Spider-Man die without doing anything about it.  I’m not doing that again.

What?

I can’t move!

--I am in the moment, it’s a terrible moment!--

Relax. Okay...

(invisible) I'm right here.63.

(invisible) I’m right in front of you. Can Spider-Man turn invisible?

Ow! You just poked me in my eye!

What’s that?

Slow down, Peter! I-- I need to write it down!

(to himself)

(to himself) Organize your desktop, lady!

(whispers) I’m just taking the whole thing! The Head Scientist turns to look at Peter.

--Peter!--

Yep.

Hey.

When did you teach me that?

Of course I’m not ready!

Whoa, whoa, I can’t do this yet!

C’mon, c’mon!

Uh oh.

I run better than I swing!

That’s too many things!

That’s the best idea you’ve had all day!

I’m doing it!

Okay. Thwip--

Thwip--

Thwip. And release.

Woohoo! And release.

I gotta say, you’re amazing man!

Peter!

What the...

(shocked) Gwanda? 73.

I like your haircut.

How many more spider people are there?

What’s Comic-Con?

I’m sorry about your friend.

Yeah. If you ever decide to do friends again, I could always open up a slot. A beat. Gwen considers.

Cool.

I was there... when it all happened. I am so sorry.

Brooklyn. (then) Did Peter have a place where we could make another one of these?

Whoa. Dude, was yours anything like this?

Hey Peter, I think this is a cape. Peter can't help smiling. Gwen, in turn, watches this happen, her wheels turning.

Kingpin knows we’re coming. We’re going to be outnumbered.

Is he in black and white?

No, no, no, you don’t get it.

None of you can stay here. If you stay here, you’ll die. I’m the guy who’s going to turn it off and I’m going to get you all home before I do. Look, I made a promise. So I have to keep it.

Yeah man.

I can’t do it on command--

I can’t do it on command--

Just those two things--

Can I what?

What?86.

I don’t know, maybe--

Dear Uncle Aaron, I gotta do something and I don’t know if I can do it. I’m scared man. I’m just tired of letting everybody down. You’re the only one I can talk to. I just wish you were here.89.

My uncle!

My Uncle Aaron, he -- he -- he's the Prowler!

He works for Kingpin, he tried to kill me!

No. I don’t think so.

(heartbroken) I guess I was followed.

Preparate a miror.  A man stupid pillows!

I got it!!

No, no, no. No! Peter kicks Prowler off himself and out through the wall into the street.

Uncle Aaron. Aaron takes off his mask as well.

(barely a whisper) Please Uncle Aaron. Kingpin calls Aaron from his car below, watching the standoff.

...Uncle Aaron. This is my fault.

Look, it was my fault. You wouldn’t understand.

Hey there!

What’s going on?

We can say goodbye at the collider.

I need to be there. So you can all go home.

You’re taking my place...? If you stay here you’ll die.

That’s not fair! You’ve gotta tell them I can do this!

I gotta make Kingpin pay! You have to let me make him pay!

But I’m ready, I promise--

When will I know I’m ready--

When do I know I’m Spider-Man?

About time right?

No, it doesn’t.

On your right! On your right!

Guys are you seeing this?!

Gwen!!113.

Thanks. I made it myself.

Guys, I got it.

Don’t watch the mouth. Watch the hands. 114. He shoots a web and swings off through the chaos in the collider room.

That was crazy. Back on Peter and Gwen.

Guys! I got control of the beam! Get up here!

I got the portal open. You first Peni.

Do I get to like the hairdo now? Gwen laughs.

Well, Einstein said time was relative, right?

Friends? A long beat. Gwen grabs his hand and holds it.

Cool.

Your turn. 117.

Peter, that wasn’t the deal!

Peter, you gotta go home!

(defiant) Neither can I.

Yeah, it is ok. 118.

(with empathy) You gotta go home man.

You won’t.

Kingpin!

Nope! Sorry. That’s cheating! He starts to advance when a subway train suddenly speeds by,

Adios!

I gotta get to that button.

Oh no...

(sadly) Is this what you want man?120.

I am stopping this! Right now!

(struggling) C’mon... c’mon... come on...

I’ll always have my family. You ever hear of the shoulder touch?

“Hey.”

Hey Kingpin! Push the green button for me!

Yeah, I’m ok. (beat) You’re probably busy so-- He’s definitely busy but doesn’t care.

I know Dad. I’m so sorry.

Do you know who did it?

(getting emotional, holding it back) Ok, dad. Alright.

Alright. Cool, yeah!

Yeah I’m Spider-man! A su servicio!

What’s up little man? Oh yeah, yeah I’m the new Spider-Man! Check it out-- (jumps onto wall, immediately falls off) Whoa! That was part of the move.

OK, let's do this one last time, yeah? For real this time. This is it.

Got hit by a drone. Did this with my dad.

Met my roommate finally.

Slapped a sticker where my Dad’s never going to find it. Ham, Peni, Noir, Gwen are in their homes, ready for a fresh start...

And when I feel alone, like no one understands what I’m going through, I remember my friends who get it.

I never thought I’d be able to do any of this stuff. But I can. Anyone can wear the mask. You can wear the mask. If you didn’t know that before, I hope you do now.

Cuz I’m Spider-Man. And I’m not the only one. Not by a long shot. He closes his eyes. Starts singing along to “Sunflower.” But his eyes snap open as a bright light suddenly shines down on him. A portal begins to open up above him. 127.
