Good.

Goblin, no! Get him out of there!

Tombstone. We’re done with tests. Get that thing ready to go again.

Run faster. These guys are weak.

I’d say it’s nice to see you again, Spider-Man. But it’s not.

Booming. Ha!

It's not always about the money, Spider-Man.

What...

Vanessa? Vanessa! Richard!

Vanessa it’s me. You know me!

Don’t go! Stay with me! Please!

You’re not stopping this. Not today.

The real Spider-Man couldn’t even beat me. You’re nothing!

You took my family, and now I’m gonna make sure you never see yours again.

What?
