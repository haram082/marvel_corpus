Another!

Have you ever known me to be nervous?

That wasn't nerves, brother. It was the rage of battle. How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive?

Some do battle, others just do tricks.

Loki... Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.

Now that was just a waste of good wine.

You don't really want to start this again, do you, Cow?

You're incapable of sincerity.

Thank you. The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:

Stop.

How do I look?

You go ahead.12. Loki casts him a wary look.

I'll be along. Go on. Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.

Why does everyone keep saying that? I'm not nervous!

...but never you. I know.

And what is that?

I swear.

I swear.

I swear.

The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!

"All is well?!"¬ù They broke into the Weapons Vault! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these

I want to know why they--

And if you hadn't taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms!

March into Jotunheim as you once did, teach them a lesson, break their spirits so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again!

They got this far!

As King of Asgard, I would--

It's unwise to be in my company right now, brother.

(re: the empty hall) This was to be my day of triumph.

It's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.

The safety of our Realm is no jest. We're going to Jotunheim.

My father fought his way into Jotunheim, defeated their armies, and took their Casket! We'd just be looking for answers.

My friends, have you forgotten all that we've done together? He turns to Fandral.23.

Who brought you into the sweet embrace of the most exotic maidens in all of Yggdrasil?

And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known?

Come on. You're not going to let my brother and me take all the glory, are you? Loki looks startled.

You are coming with me...24.

We must first find a way to get past Heimdall.

I have no plans to die today.

Come on. Don't be bashful. The others join him at his side, then step towards the Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom, changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked off the platform and inside the vortex.

Too late now.

For what?

It feels good, doesn't it? To be together again, adventuring on another world?

What would you call it?

How about a song to lift our spirits? The others groan.

I speak only to your King. Not to his foot soldiers.

And I am--

How did your people get into Asgard?

Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies.

Not when you'd use it to make war against other Realms. Laufey laughs, cold, mocking.

This boy has grown tired of your mockery.

Know your place, brother...

Next! Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.

Come on! At least make it a

(re: the fallen Brute)

Come on!

Then go!

I can stop them! The others hesitate. Jotuns break up through the ice all around them.

Now! We'll finish them together!

Why did you bring us back?

I was protecting my home.

Whatever the cost, the world must know that the new King of Asgard will not be held in contempt.

While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us! The old ways are done. You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls!

Hammer...46.

Father! Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the bridge!47.

You! What world is this? The group is intimidated by his fervor.

Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy reaches into her fanny pack, pulls something out of it. Jane looks on, concerned.

What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?

How dare you attack the son of Odin!

Then bring me a healing stone, you savages!

Blue sky... one sun... This is Earth, isn't it?

(re: coffee mug)

It was delicious. I want another.

I just did.

I meant no disrespect.

You have my word.

Where?!

Twelve miles east of here. He starts to stride determinedly down the street. Jane walks with him.

To get what belongs to me.

It's not what they say it is.

Yes. He stops walking.

If you take me there now, I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

All the answers you seek will be yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. Darcy looks to the others.

I understand. Then this is where we say goodbye. He takes her hand and kisses it.

Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down the street. Selvig looks relieved.

I need a horse.

Then give me one of those, large enough to ride.

Many times. You're brave to do it.78.

But you're clever. Far more clever than anyone else in this Realm.

You think me strange? Jane laughs, catches herself.

Good strange or bad strange?

You'll see soon enough.

What you seek -- it's a bridge.

More like a rainbow bridge. A beat.

You're going to need this.

Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I will return what they stole from you.80. He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his request.

Deal?

No. Jane looks relieved.

You're big.

Fought bigger.

Just a man.

Loki? What are you doing here?

What's happened? Tell me! Is it Jotunheim? Let me explain to

What?

Can I come home?

But couldn't we find a way to--

No, I'm sorry. Loki... thank you for coming here.94.

Good-bye.

Thank you for what you've done.

Are you in love with her?

Neither did I. Selvig eyes him with interest.

I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

I had it all backwards. I had it all wrong.

For the first time in my life, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful.

I will not fight him.

Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder.

He's fine. Not injured at all.

Sorry, my friend.

We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud.

These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her.

You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve.

It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry.

What's wrong?106.

You must do this. You must finish what you've started.

This is how my father explained it to me...

You're very welcome. Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates.

To replace the one I broke. Please forgive my behavior. She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.

If I may, I'd like to come back for more of your "coffee."¬ù

My friends!

My friends, I've never been happier to see anyone. But you should not have come.

You know I can't. My father is dead because of me. I must remain in exile.116. The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.

Leave this town now. Get yourself and your friends to safety.

I'm still a warrior, and I will fight by your side.

Help me clear the streets. I'll let none of these people die this day.

Go, while you can!

You can't help them now. Your job is to survive.122. She struggles to sit up.

Live and tell those stories yourself.

But not win. Move Volstagg, or he'll die!

Don't worry, my friends. I have a plan.

Brother... for whatever I have done to wrong you, whatever I have done to lead you to do this, I am sorry. But these people have done nothing to you. They are innocents. He continues towards the Destroyer.

Take my life, and know I will never return to Asgard.123.

Heimdall! Open the Bifrost!125.

He would open it if he could. I fear the worst.

Heimdall!

Know this, son of Coul. You and I, we fight for the same cause -- the protection of this world. From this day forward, count me as your ally.

Whatever fate lies before me, you are part of it.

(to the others) Get him to the healing room! Leave my brother to me.

No thanks to you. Frigga picks up on the tension building between her sons.

Why don't you tell her? How you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends? To kill me? Frigga looks to Loki, alarmed and confused.

You're a talented liar, brother. Always have been.

Jotunheim...

Why have you done this?

He won't! You can't kill an entire race!

I've changed.

Is the throne really worth what you've done? What you would become?

I will not fight you, brother.

Loki, this is madness... Loki grins.

Forgive me.

No!

There will never be a wiser king than you. Or a better father.

Can you see her? Heimdall turns, gazes out towards Earth.
