There was the time in Nornheim...

As I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape.

Just a bit of fun. (to the Attendant)

(re: Thor's helmet) Nice feathers.11.

I was being sincere!

Am I? He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.

I've looked forward to this day as long as you have. You're my brother and my friend. Sometimes I'm envious, but never doubt that I love you. Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony. He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his brother's shoulder.

Give us a kiss.

Like a king.

It's time.

He said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.

I wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does. Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the lower level --

Who said I was wise?

It will come. In time.

No... stop there! I know that look!22.

It's madness!

Nothing! Thor was making a jest!

What?

Yes, of course! I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone. I will be at his side.

I'm sorry?

You must be mistaken. We're not--

Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother.

To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.

Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered.

We will accept your most gracious offer. The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant nearby mutters under his breath.

Damn.

(to the falling Giant) Pathetic.

That can't be good.

I told him.

I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long.

I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.

And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous.

Am I cursed?

What am I?

The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day, was it? Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.

Laufey's son... He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.

Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun blood. Why would you take me?

You took me for a purpose, what was it? Odin doesn't answer.

Tell me!

So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me.

You could have told me what I was from the beginning. Why didn't you?

Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?

It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.

Guards!62.

So why did he lie?65.

How long will it last?

I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.

What hope is there for Thor?

My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard.

Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again.

She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your "urgent"¬ù matter to me, your King. Sif covers quickly.

My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of this.

All of us must stand together, for the good of Asgard.

I had to see you.

Father is dead.

Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear.

You mustn't blame yourself. I know that you loved him. I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen.

The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.

The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.

Mother has forbidden your return. Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.

This is goodbye, brother. I'm so sorry.

Nothing could have stopped me.

Fare well, brother.

I've come alone and unarmed.

To make you another proposition.98.

You're welcome.

Hello, Father.

No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens. Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me. This gives Laufey pause.

I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies. I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket.

When all is done, we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds. Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could.

No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told. Laufey considers the proposition.

What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.

You have great power, Heimdall. Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?

And why is that?

You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King.114.

Ensure my brother does not return.

Father. Welcome to Asgard.

And your death came by the son of Odin.

I swear to you, mother, they will pay for what they've done today. I will end the Jotun threat, now and forever! He looks to Odin.

Found its way back to you, did it?

It must have been enforcing Father's last command.129.

You can't stop it. The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.

To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done.

What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands.

So have I.

Fight me.131. He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his

I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me!

I am not your brother. I never was.

Is it?

What happened to you on earth that turned you so soft? Don't tell me it was a woman.

It was. Perhaps when we're finished here I'll pay her a little visit myself.

Thor! Help me!133.

Please...
