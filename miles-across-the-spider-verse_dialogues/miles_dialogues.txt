Hey Lenny, how much I owe you for this beef patty, man?

So... are you like a cow or a dalmatian?

Of course not. So is that a costume?

Oh dang.

Hold up--

Uh oh. Well this has been fun, but I really gotta wrap this up.

Ok, let’s do this one last time.

And things are going...great.

Come on, man. You could hurt somebody!

Catching all sorts of bad guys...26.

I designed my new suit, with some fly ambiance down the side.

Aunt May moved to Florida.

I guest hosted Jeopardy.

Endorsed baby powder.

Apologized for endorsing baby powder...

I made a mistake.

My mustache came in... and out.

I made another mistake.

I’m developing a new twist on my venom thing.

Sorry!

How much longer can I keep lying about who I really am?

(awkward laugh) He seems more Dominican to me!

I mean, would they get it if I told them?

... maybe in some other universe.

Sometimes I just wish I wasn’t the only one. But I don’t dwell on it.

I miss my Uncle sometimes...

Even though he turned out to be the Prowler... - Flashes of Uncle Aaron / the Prowler from the first film.

I try to do what he told me... “Just keep going.”

Sorry sorry, just a second, man.

Sorry, I just really gotta be somewhere --

(texting) Almost there, Mami, smiley face... prayer hands.

At the end of the day... I’m Spider-Man.

And no one can take that away from me. He pats Spot on the head dismissively and swings away.

Don't escape!

Yo, wassup, man?

There’s a bad guy on the roof of the Peterson building. Can you call the police, tell em to pick him up?

Just this one time?32.

Are those my Jordans? Um. Maybe?

Unless you bake two cakes!

How’s this going? College! Woot- woot!

-- five minutes early, I know, I know. Look, I gotta get back to being a great student so can we make this quick?

Calmate Mami, eso no es my fault.

Mom, I just missed a few classes --

I mean, y’know, like... five?

I just have a lot going on...

Having a story at all seems gross.

Correct.

New Jersey’s too far from New York?

Princeton has the best quantum researchers in the country.

They’re moving electrons across dimensional thresholds.36.

They’re studying dark matter!

I could help figure out how to travel to other dimensions.

Dad. When you were my age you followed your dream and went out on your own to start a business with Uncle Aaron, right?

You all got me into this school because you thought I could do something special and now I think so too. And the special thing I want to do is this. There are people out there who can teach me the things I want to learn... but they aren’t all in Brooklyn. Rio and Jeff trade looks. This is a lot to swallow.

Are you kidding me?

Ooh. I gotta go.

You guys just keep talking. This is all great stuff.

Totally, y’know, call me! Uh, I gotta go, alright? Bye!

How’s your essay? Ganke is still on the bed playing video games.

Oh really?

Thanks, I’m on it.

Yeah, alright. Thanks for the tip.

Officer Morales! I mean -- (deep accented voice) Officer Morales.

I did not! It was at the end.

Bad guy? He’s barely a villain of the week!

Everything is --

I am?! Haha that’s so silly! Wha--? Imagine that.

Don’t try to wow me with big words. I do the crossword every day. Jeff, left behind, readies himself to jump into the scary

What are you talking about?

I really don’t?

Dude, you are not.

Uh... no.

What?

I’ve hit a lot of different villains with a lot of different food. Jeff, finally catching up to the other two, slides down to

I’m just trying to lighten the mood.44.

I didn’t! He’s talking crazy.

He... kicked his own butt.

I always do... Jeff walks away.

... usually. Overhead, a police car dangles from a sky-bound portal.

(still in his weird low ‘Brooklyn’ accent:) Us?

I mean, I’m trying too.

I’m a great role model.46.

Do you... want to talk about it?

Well, men of your generation ignore their mental health too long.

I know the feeling. (then) So, your son... how’s he doing? You think he’s gonna figure it all out?

Yeah... ?

Yeah?!

Cool. Well, I should probably --47.

(muttering) Maybe get off the kid’s ass --

What? I don’t know?

Maybe he’s scared to talk to you.

Uh -- I dunno.

Well, as an objective observer with no skin in the game, I say, you got to let him spread his wings, man.

If this isn’t nice, what is? (Jeff stares at him) I should go.

Don’t worry, I don’t think that guy is gonna show his face again.

“... and I want you to know, no matter what, even though we’ve had our ups and downs, I am so proud of you today, and every day,

Can’t you write smaller?

“Courtesy of your --” Oh no. Wait! -- the cab drives off with the dang cakes. NO NO NO NO NO! 55.

Heyyy / Hola...primo. / You know...56.

I don’t know why, I’ve just been here the whole time.

Ah!! Hi.

I know but --

Did you even see the cakes? There’s some heartfelt messages on them. He opens the boxes to reveal two mushed up cakes. The only intelligible words remaining say “I’m not” and “proud.”

That’s... not what I meant.

There was an emergency.  57.

Sounds like you’re explaining it pretty well.

(mouth squeezed) I don’t feel grown up... Maria sees a bit of spider-suit peeking out from his sleeve --

Hey’ve you checked out the spread? -- right back into his mom and dad. Did they teleport?

Yes you did!

I have more friends than just Ganke.

Um... well, there’s Peter. But he left town. There’s... Gw--anda, y’know, she... also left town.

Is that Spanglish? Well that certainly wasn’t worth it.

Has it ever occurred to you that maybe I’m just doing benign private unremarkable things when I’m not with you guys?

I am 15 years old! I am basically an adult!

Neither does mom!59.

It’s my life!

Alright. Whatever. Too far. Way too far.

What?! For how long?!

Dad. Mom. Are you--? Seriously?!

You don’t understand!60.

You know what... never mind. ... he walks off. Jeff, in response:

Two months. Pff. I’m Spider-Man. I’m not grounded.

How did you get --

How... have you been?

Yeah. Your hair has gotten... pinker.

It is, but my dorm room is very adult.

That’s a collectable...

That’s fine.

What? No --

So what are you doing here? I mean, I thought I’d never see you again --

I’m... grounded.

Wait, hold on. There’s an elite society with all the best spider- people in it??

Motorcycle?

Yeah I’ve learned a lot of stuff too. Leveled up my whole thing.

Easy!

Right. And... who’s Miguel?

A vampire good guy? I’d pay good money to see that.

So how long ago did they invite you?

Months is kind of a long time...

Look at me. They grab hotdogs from a street vendor, webbing cash to him as they swing by.

Keep the change! (back to Gwen) So this club --

-- what kinda stuff do you do?

I thought we did that already. ... and web the thief to a lamppost...

Wait, who’s Hobie?

What does that mean? You stay overnight? Or... But she flies off. So light and happy it seems evasive... like she’s using her new friends to avoid her old life?

Right. So, uh, why’d you come now? They’re standing casually on the side of a moving subway. A kid inside the train won’t stop licking the window.66.

(to kid) Don’t -- don’t do that. (turns back to Gwen) Hey, Uh... Gwen? But she’s already gone.

Where’d you go?

Hey, there you are. Whatcha doing?

Right? I mean who needs a treadmill when you have the Williamsburg Bank Building?

So, uh, you and your dad -- you still haven’t talked?67.

I mean, I don’t know... my parents, maybe if I told them --

Well... maybe some things are supposed to be just for us.

I’m just a really emotionally intelligent guy. Beyond my years. Gwen laughs softly. He’s got her number, too.

Yeah? He moves closer.

You don’t even know.

What?

(playfully) Other than Hobie, right?

Yeah? How’s that?

We’re the same.

In the important ways, y’know? There’s an inevitability to them. They can feel it.

Well... there’s a first time for everything, right? She brightens. Around him, it all seems possible. She leans against his shoulder. 69.

Oh yeah. These plátanos are just deep-fried feelings.

This thing keeps you from glitching in other dimensions?

What’s it gonna take for Miguel

I’m just saying, if I had a watch I could come with you. I did save the multi-verse!

I can turn invisible...

I have like, electric powers--

Ah, right.

I know, I know.

Alright, jeez.

Okay. I’m sorry. It’s --

Oh boy.

Gwanda and I are friends from school.

Mom!72.

Really?

Yeah, bye.

I can hear you being quiet, Mom. Busted. She’s lingered here to console her son.

No one my age says those words in that order, mom.

Well... He tugs at the cuff of his spider-suit. Should he tell her?

I’m... (never mind) I’m sorry I was late. Rio knows there’s so much he isn’t saying. She closes her eyes, takes a deep breath, then --

Is this a trick?

What are you --?

(laughs) Yeah, okay.

I promise.

Alright.

Bendición, mami. He kisses her cheek. This casual goodbye -- literally ‘may I have your blessing?’ -- has a little more meaning tonight.

Yeah, I figured. See ya later. With a cake. Rio watches her only child disappear into the city. Knowing he’s not really a child anymore.

Shoot.

He’s trying to make himself more powerful so he can beat me.

Uh... congratulations! Welcome to

Gwen! I’m here to help! Gwen turns to see --

Oh no.

I got you! ... and nabs her inches before she’s pavement pizza. But she’s not as happy as he would have hoped:

Uh. No, I just saw where you went and went there without you knowing.

What are you talking about, I’m

Dang.

Uh, no... I’m not--GWEN Wow, Pav, that’s... totally wrong.84.

Who are you?

I’m not a new gu--

Six? And even he got a watch?

You don’t use any product at all?

I love chai tea!85.

Oh, um, no. I’m sorry. Now that that’s cleared up...

I think he means me.

C’mon man! I think maybe we got off on the wrong foot. Let’s just talk about this!87.

That doesn’t make any sense!

I’m okay. Don’t worry!

If Spot gets more holes, he’ll be unstoppable. We can’t let him get to-

What should I know about Hobie? 88.

Collider sequence? Oh no.

You don’t know what you’re doing!

I’m sorry I called you that, okay? You’re a great villain.

Stand back. I’ve been working on something new.

No! I’m absorbing it so I can shoot it back!

Please hold your questions until I’m done breaking this thing! Almooooossssst ttthhhheeeeerrrrrrreeeeee--

Just let me do this!!

Hobie?! Strong, long, and skinny-hot, covered in torn plaids and denims, a spiked mohawk coming out of his spider-mask, a throbbing electric guitar slung across his back. Yeah, this guy rules.

What’s this dude saying?

You understand this guy?

I loosened it --

Hi. I’ve never heard of because Gwen barely ever mentions you.

I thought you hated labels.

What’s a jumper?

How many sweaters do you have?

Wait what?

Aren’t you in a band?

Oh this guy’s killing me.

You’re not a joke! Right, gang?

No one here thinks you’re a joke!

What was that? Spot seeps in roiling dark energy like a human black hole.

No...

(to Hobie) We’ll clear the path, you slow down that building.

I got him!

Don’t worry! Thread the needle, ring the bell, right?

I’ll be okay, I promise.

I promised.

(to Gwen) Not bad right?98.

So... what do you think?

We make a good team.

I’m invited to HQ????!!!!

How are you even cooler under your mask?

Dang...

Yo, this place is wild!

(in awe) This is unbelievable!

Oh.

What happened to that small elite strike team?

Oh! My own watch?!

I wouldn’t call it a mess, more like a success in progress.

Is he okay?

Why does the horse need a mask?

Who is in these...laser cages?

(pointedly to Gwen) Oh that’s interesting.

I love video games!104.

(whipping around) Prowler?!

Hey.

Uh... how many missions have you been on together?

That’s cool >:(105.

Sorry.

I’m Spider-Man.

Whoa, what are you?

I hear that.

What does that do?

(to Margo) Uh, see you around?

Okay bye! Margo watches him go. Something about this kid...

Maybe it did before you ripped it out of a wall?

And what’s that?

To get a watch. 108.

They’re fine. I mean, we got in a fight, but they just want what’s best for me.

Why...?

Then why are you here? Good question.

I want to be in a band. I wanna see my friends and I need a watch to do that.

Hey! ¿Qué tal tio? I speak Spanish. Te trajé una empanada.

Listen, I--I’m really excited to get going and-- I have some fresh new ideas on how to catch The Spot. He just wants to be taken seriously, y’know? Like as we all do--MIGUEL(CONT’D) Oh great. Oh wow. Uh huh uh huh.

What did I do?

Fault? Hold up --

I do know what not know what?

What’s happening?

Dude!

You look... solid, y’know?

Peter you gotta tell them-- wait. What is that?

You have a baby!

This is crazy! Peter chases after his daughter with a familiar bracelet --

Canon event?

That’s insulting.

Wait what are you upset about? I saved those people --

What’s this?

(...) Can you be more specific?

The Spider-Verse.

And these nodes, where the lines converge?

Uncle Aaron...

(to Peter) That happened to you? Peter’s eyes say it all.

I thought you were trying to save me.

That wasn’t me, that was the Spot!

How do you know?

My dad is about to be captain...

Spot does it. He kills him. (then) When does it happen? No one wants to say it.

When does it happen?!

Send me home.

What am I supposed to do? Just let him die? Miguel stands, unwavering.

(turning to Gwen) What about your dad? He’s a captain, right?

And that’s it. You’re just aren’t gonna do anything about it. Gwen can’t find any words.

(to Peter B) Ok, what about Uncle Ben? That have been okay if you knew and just let it play out?

So we’re just supposed to let people die because some algorithm --

-- says that that’s supposed to happen? You realize how messed up that sounds right? More Spider-People step into the room...

I can do both. Spider-Man always --

Peni? (then) What is this? Is this an

(to Peter) Is that why you’re here? To let me down easy? Worked last time, why not run it back, huh?

Stop calling me that.

You can’t ask me not to save my father!

Can this day get any damn weirder?

I guess it can!

Hi.

Thanks!124.

Uh...

Then stop chasing me!125.

No no no no, let me go.

Running is the least crazy thing going on!

Good!

What?

No!

I’m plenty juvenated!

You don’t get to have a heartfelt conversation with me right now!

Then why didn’t you come see me?

I wanted to be with you guys so badly. But this thing isn’t what I thought it was.

Hey -- I don’t -- listen...

We did.

Oh I have a plan. I just haven’t told you yet!

That’s not good.

What are those, claws?! Dude, are you sure you’re even Spider-Man?

I’m pretty sure you know the rest, jerk!

Not if you let me go home!

No --

No! You’re lying! I’m Spider-Man!

Get off of me --

Let me go --

You talked about this? You knew? You all knew?

That’s why you never came to see me.132.

Who decides that? I’m not a kid, Gwen!

Yeah, well I did lure hundreds of Spider-People away from your little clubhouse.

And -- I’m about to do this:

Everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go. Nah. Im’ma do my own thing.

Goodbye, Gwen.133.

I can do both! Spider-Man always --

breathless, slipping, he makes a final desperate swing through the rain, through a window, and into, finally

I made it... I’m home.

Am I too late?!

Are you guys okay? Tell me you’re okay!

You were right. You were right about everything.

I saw all these amazing places, and met all these amazing people. But --

But they didn’t want me. But I kept thinking about what you said. I let em have it, mom. I beat ‘em all. I know how strong I am now. I’m strong because of you. And dad.

Mom, there’s something coming for us. Something terrible.

His name is Spot. He’s my nemesis. And I’m gonna stop him. The hell is this kid talking about?

I know you know I’ve been lying to you. It’s because I thought if you knew, you wouldn’t love me the same. Then I went out there... and now, I’m not afraid of anything.

You gotta promise nothing’s gonna change. 147.

Mom... I’m Spider-Man. He unzips the jacket to reveal his spider-suit underneath.

The superhero? He got bit by a spider? It gave him spider-powers? He’s me?

I don’t know what that is --

I had a nightmare about that once but no --

Wherever he is -- it’s still raining. He follows Rio into the hallway. There’s a gnawing feeling at the back of his head -- something’s off...

Mom! Stop playing around. This is serious! Dad worked with Spider- Man. He didn’t realize Spider-Man was me at the time but -- ugh, I wish dad was here to explain this.

Mom hold on. I need to talk to you--

Oh no.

That machine... ...didn’t send me home. A doorknob rustling. The door opens. And in walks

I missed you so much.

Uh... I’m still getting used to it?

Right. Yeah, I’m following you and what... you are... saying.

I... have a cold.151.

Uh... yeah. But maybe we should go over it one more time just to make sure there’s no... problems.

(realizing) There’s no Spider-Man here...

(groggy) Uncle Aaron...

You don’t understand. I’m not from here. The machine sent me here by mistake wait wait wait Uncle Aaron!

Uncle Aaron, just hear me out--

I was bit by a spider that gave me powers. It was’t supposed to bite me, it was supposed to bite someone else. Someone from here. I don’t belong here. I need to go home. Or my dad - your brother- is going to die. I have an Uncle Aaron too -- I had one. He was a bad guy called the Prowler, he looked out for me. He did a lot of bad things but -- I knew he wanted to be good. He just didn’t know he had a choice, but you do. You can be a good guy.

Please, trust me. I know you don’t want to be the Prowler--

What?156.

Yeah.

Who are you? He unmasks...

If I don’t get home, our dad is going to die.

Please. You have to let me go.
