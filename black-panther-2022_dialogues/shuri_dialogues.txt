His heart rate is dropping fast. Where are we?

Recreating the Heart-Shaped Herb is my last chance.

Sho! (beat) What’s the confidence rate?

Print it.

Griot, what is my brother’s heart rate?

Give me one second... I’m in the middle of something. The scientists and technologists cut looks as...

Mother.

Griot, shut down.

There could be any number of unknown threats on the horizon. They are creating solutions.

Space suits for the Dora Milaje in case Thanos wasn’t just an aberration.   But as always Okoye had some notes.

She hated them. Ramonda smiles.

Maybe you should continue those calculations.

We don’t need the herb. We need new technology. Yellow Rev. (06/28/21) 19. Green Rev. (07/11/21) 20.

The mantle is a relic, mother. I wasn’t trying to save the Black Panther with the herb, I was trying to save my brother... and I failed.

Tuesday. Ramonda looks at her.

Brother’s passing.

Do you have anything planned?

Right now?

There is a ritual for everything here. Somebody has died, you have to do the ritual. My neighbor hates me, oh just do ritual. I can’t find a boyfriend... don’t worry there’s a ritual for that.

Ugh. Don’t mention her name. I know she hated being here, but that is no excuse for missing his funeral.

Because that was my brothers’ day. And for some stupid reason rituals mattered to him. I don’t have time for this, Mother. I need to get back to my lab.

I have healed. (beat) I wake up every day, and I work on things for Wakanda’s future. Even though my brother is gone. (alt) I’m not like I was before. I’m moving forward, even though my brother is gone. Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 23. Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 24.

But that wasn’t us, mother. In the snap, everything that we were, ceased to exist. Our presence was a construct of your mind. Brought on so you could experience comfort, or joy.

How did you get these?

These are my clothes. How do they figure into your ritual? Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 24.

I was wearing those clothes, the last time I held him, mother. (turns, resolute) I cannot burn them.

Mother! What are you doing?

This better not be a part of the ritual...

What kind of name is Namor-

Mother, he’s covered in it. Ramonda observes Namor’s VB necklace and earrings.

And the Americans detected it

Of course not.

Did you see those things on his ankles?

It’s you. I haven’t touched them since the last time you saw them. Ramonda studies the vibranium detector.

Yes, I’m still not sure how they did it though. It can detect the altered frequency of vibranium through water, stone, even heavy metals. (beat) Whoever built this is brilliant .

Of course not. But it’s strange - the parts are mismatched. Some are custom, others look like they pulled it from a junkyard.

Vibranium is all around us. We have never needed anything like this. Necessity breeds invention. Okoye ponders this.

Perhaps the meteorite that struck the continent, broke apart as it entered the earth’s atmosphere. The planet is mostly covered by water. It’s reasonable that some landed there.

That sounds very painful.

So when do we leave to see my favorite colonizer?

For our own safety, we can’t tell you. But it’s imperative that we get to this scientist before anything else happens. (beat) I wouldn’t be here otherwise. (off Ross’ hesitancy) You owe me. You owe my brother. Ross relents.

It’s a student mother. We can’t give her to Namor.

I think it would be more discreet if I spoke with her.

No I did it correctly. Fenty 440. I just look more like a student. That’s all.

Riri Williams?

It’s an encrypted file, I figured I could airdrop it. Riri looks up from her phone. Clocks the Princess of Wakanda. Her jaw drops.

It was a school project?

I know that feeling. Brilliance at a young age is not easily digested by the elders. (beat) How long did it take you?

Not just us. How old are you?

It is not safe for you here. I’m afraid you have to gather you things and come with me.

Yeah, your phone isn’t going to work for a bit.

(to Okoye) You look fine. (to Riri) Yellow Rev. (06/28/21) 37.

What are you building in here?

Shit.

My AI.

We need to work together to get out of here.

They’ve got the place surrounded. We should split up.

Everything in this lab works. (eyes a motorcycle) How about this bike?

I knew it! Don’t tell me you built this in a couple of months too.

Have you flown it yet?

So we can communicate.

You’ve done this before...

General, they have us surrounded. It will be easier if the three of us split up.

Now Griot!

We were supposed to split up!

This thing is a rocket!

You either.

Not this time.

Okay Griot, now!Buff Rev. (08/21/21) 46. Buff Rev. (08/21/21) 47.

Nice one right? Okoye gives a “so-so” shrug.

Two more behind us. Inside the Barracuda, Okoye sees a police car approaching in her rearview mirror.

How high?

Is your suit capable of reaching that altitude?

Riri, that drone is too high for you to reach without an oxygen mask.

But I think it’s too high for you to reach without an oxygen mask.

It should be clear across the river.

Wait!

Translate...

Riri calm down, we’re okay. Riri scans the room, and starts hyperventilating.

Breathe Riri.

In a cave.

Don’t look over there. Look at me.

Riri, close your eyes. Take deep breaths through your nose. Riri obliges. Goldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 65. Yellow Rev. (06/28/21) 66.

Deep breaths. Nobody here is going to hurt you. I promise. Breathe deep.

What do you like?

Okay... Think about a great car... Driving on the open road... just guzzling gasoline...

We saved your life as well.

No.

That’s not how it works anymore. The Black Panther is gone.

Not completely.

I think it might be their custom. (holds it up) You should see what I have to wear to Warrior Falls.

I’ll be back. You’re driving the car. Tires on the asphalt.

I like this one. Namor smiles.

Your mother was human.Green Rev. (07/11/21) 68. Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 69.

How..? Namor thinks on this and smiles.

Why are you telling me all of this?

I understand. But what if we kept her in Wakanda? Let us go and I promise she will remain in my country.

Keep me then and let her go.

...this cave?

I would love to see it.Green Rev. (07/11/21) 72.

Yes. The earrings work as amplifiers? Namor smiles.

Brilliant.

(astonished) You can grow corn underwater?

Can we go there?

These temples and structures. This entire place is remarkable. The engineering and science behind this has to be extraordinarily advanced. (taking in the Sastun)

When Namor says yes, we have to be ready. Can you do it?

What he needs done isn’t so difficult. It’s what we need that will take time... (beat) If I can get some raw vibranium, I should be able to build an amplifier for my kimoyo beads and make a homing signal.

If they’re close enough to us. Riri shakes her head.Goldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 82. Green Rev. (07/11/21) 83.

Do you want to be down here forever?Green Rev. (07/11/21) 83. Goldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 84. On cue, Namor and Namora emerge from the pool.

How old were you when you built your first machine?

It’s been a while since I picked up a hammer.

I have a staff for that. Riri looks at her.

The fiber optic cables?

I’m thinking.

That was no date. He wants go to war with the surface and asked for my help. (beat) It wouldn’t be long before nuclear weapons were being launched into the oceans which would be very bad for everyone.

It could have been a hundred miles from the cave you found us in, could have been several thousand.

It is only a matter of time before they come back.

Wait. Where is Okoye? Have you heard from her? Did she make it home?

There is a but, coming. I can feel it.

You’re not serious.

We were ambushed by superhuman merpeople, mother. You have to reinstate her.

I need to get to my lab.

As to be expected.

Go, examine Riri Williams please. She is with my mother.

(clocking her uniform) Did mother fire you as well?

Keep them. You might need them. Green Rev. (07/11/21) 97. Green Rev. (07/11/21) 98.

I don’t know how long we have before Namor comes looking for me. Or the American scientist.

Yes. And...it is beautiful. But Aneka, these people are incredibly strong. They have to be, just to survive the pressure of the ocean depths. Green Rev. (07/11/21) 98. Green Rev. (07/11/21) 99.

And they know where we are.

I’m in the lab but I’m headed towards the city.

I’m with Aneka, they’ll need air support.  Green Rev. (07/11/21) 103. Green Rev. (07/11/21) 104.

(making crackling noises with her mouth) What’s that? You’re breaking up. Love you. Bye.

No, I just hung up in my mom’s face... there’s a difference. You coming with?

Go away.

Leave me alone.

Shut up, spy. Leave, like you always do.

No I don’t! Everyone I love is gone. All of them. I have nothing left.

What am I to you? A job you are no good at.

You swore to lay down your life to protect my family... but they are gone and you’re still here. If you had any honor left, you would not show your face. This lands on Okoye. Okoye turns away and starts to leave, Nakia tries to grab her but Okoye pulls away and heads back off into the forest.

And you... you swore yourself to my brother then ran off when we needed you most.

It hurts too much. I can’t bear it.

Then why can’t I feel them? Why can’t I hear them? I want to hold them. Feel their warmth. I want to tell my mother how much she meant to me. I prayed to Bast after T’Challa died, I asked him to take me before my mother. I let the prayer comfort me. I let myself believe the lies.

I did not ask you for your advice, Jabari.

What does it matter to you what I think? I am but a child who scoffs at tradition.

The elders are desperate. The city is vulnerable. If you provide them with this, they will owe the Jabari a great debt. There is nothing for you to lose but space. And there seems to be plenty of that to be had in the mountains.

I just buried the last person who truly knew me. My heart was buried with her. All I have now is a thirst for vengeance. Now if you will excuse me Lord M’Baku, I would like to continue to think about how I will go about taking it.

Any sign of Okoye?

How is Jabariland? Are you staying warm out there?

Yes. I am still trying to understand the science behind it. (beat)

My mother died saving your life. I’m not putting you back into the line of fire.

I’ll let my staff know to get you whatever you need. But I need something in return. I want you to teach me all about combustion engines, petroleum, and everything else you use to pollute the atmosphere. (beat) I think I may be able to weaken Namor through exposure to extreme heat.

The Black Panther would stand a chance. Riri sees the bracelet - puts two-and-two together.

Immediately.

Okay Griot...guess we’re back in business. (beat) Let’s start by running a comparative analysis between the Heart-Shaped-Herb and the fibers from this bracelet. Since both were grown from vibraniun-rich soil, they may share some base-level similarities we can exploit.

Griot. What is the confidence rate?

Griot! I thought you said my security system was War Dog proof...

I’m fine. Why haven’t you gone back to Haiti? You don’t have to stay here for me.

The last time I tried to recreate the Heart Shaped Herb was the day T’Challa died.

It seems that way. But I’ll know for sure soon enough. (beat) If it fails, I don’t know how we will have a shot at defeating Namor and his army. If it works, it means I was a year too late to save him.

I’m happy I don’t have to do this alone.

If it glows. The printer finishes and the women watch for a beat, when suddenly a subtle purple glow emanates from the completed herb. The women rejoice. Goldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 127. Buff Rev. (08/21/21) 128.

No. If I go into cardiac arrest, I want you to have access to my chest.

Mother?

N’Jadaka!

(to herself) This can’t be right. T’Challa saw Baba. (to Killmonger) How did I end up with you?

That’s impossible! I would never choose you.

So I can see my family. Killmonger’s eyes appear deeply remorseful.

No. Killmonger nods. Goldenrod Rev. (08/03/21) 129.

So I could become strong.

So that I may kill the man who murdered my mother. Killmonger smiles.

You took it for yourself and burned the rest. You were afraid of that you would be replaced. You’re a coward.

Don’t speak of my brother. It’s because of you he’s dead. You destroyed the herb and left us with no protector. Then Namor struck and killed my mother. Their blood is on your hands.

I am not my brother. I will close Namor’s eyes for good. Killmonger smiles. The flames rage around the room.

...None of them came to me. Not baba, my mother or T’Challa.

No one.

The ancestors abandoned me.

Well the herb didn’t work then.

Don’t tell me to calm down! I did everything I was supposed to do. The herb, the ritual, and they still did not come!

I recreated it. (alt) Clearly... I recreated it.

You’re welcome to find out the old fashioned way M’Baku.

Still unsure, Jabari?

We draw them out. The Elders listen intently.

Dehydrating Namor should severely weaken him, giving us our greatest opportunity to kill him.

Very well. I don’t require your allegiance. Or the allegiance of anyone here, if they don’t wish to follow the Black Panther into battle with a man who murdered their Queen... so be it. The room takes that in.

He claimed to be over 5 centuries old.

Was my mother not worth eternal war?

My mother died protecting the innocent. Namor will attack the surface. Maybe not in our lifetimes, but in the lifetimes of the children of Wakanda and the other nations of the world. We have a way to stop him now, and I am willing to die doing just that, so no others will have to feel the pain that I feel now. For those that wish to fight, we leave in the morning.

I will deal with Namor my way.

Now Griot!

No. I am the spirit of a murdered * queen, the wrath of a wounded * nation, I am the Black Panther! And * I am here for retribution.

I don’t care about the child. Hypocrite. Was the scientist not a child? You were hellbent on killing her.

It is only a matter of time for you. What’s the matter? Do you need some water? Namor looks around realizing he is in a massive dehumidifier.

(saluting) Wakanda Forever.

If I kill you, your people will never stop coming for Wakanda. That would mean a death sentence for Talocan as well. Vengeance will not consume my people. And it will not consume yours. (beat) Yield and Wakanda will protect the oceans. Yield and Wakanda will protect your secret. (then) Yield and they will live. (beat) And so will you. Namor’s face softens.Green Rev. (07/11/21) 150. Green Rev. (07/11/21) 151.

Loyalty. (beat) If war comes, as a result of these events. You and Talocan’s armies will fight alongside Wakanda.

Griot, send the Sunbird to return us to the battlefield.

If you ever step down or lose your throne, I promise you, I will find and kill you for taking my mother from me. I’m sure you can understand. Namor does.

All set to head home?

Don’t worry, we took care of that. But you might wanna slow down on your homework for hire business. Riri stands there awkwardly. She looks at her suit.

Yes. Your suit is a beautiful design, but I can’t let you take it with you.

Thank you. Truly. Wakanda owes you a great deal.

There’s one thing I need to show you though.

It took me a while to find all of the parts from the river. But I think it was worth it.

I could tell it meant a lot to you.

Every part. We’ll have it shipped to Boston. It will be there when you arrive.

And Riri.

I know you stole the code for my AI. You can keep it. But if you need anything in the future, just ask. Riri looks back, caught red handed. Buff Rev. (08/21/21) 157. Buff Rev. (08/21/21) 158. Riri smiles nervously and heads out.

You know, you don’t need to do this anymore. Okoye, dressed in casual clothes steps out into view.

Protect me.

You came all the way out here for that?

Are you going back to the Dora?  Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 159.

And you are, okay with that?

Where are you going to go?

I thought you said it was ugly. Okoye smiles.

Thank you, for everything. Okoye turns and gives a subtle, yet strong Wakanda forever salute, and walks off into the distance.

I think I’m good to do it on my own. Nakia smiles and nods.

Yes.

Hi.

Did mother meet him?

Toussaint is a beautiful name. There is a rich history behind it.

Yes. Toussaint looks around to make sure he isn’t being watched.

Ungubani? Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 160. Tan Rev. (02/23/22) 161.
