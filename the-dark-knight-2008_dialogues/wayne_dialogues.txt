But I learn from my mistakes.

My armor... I'm carrying too much weight- I need to be faster.

A dog. (offlook) A big dog.  There were more copycats last night, Alfred.  With guns.

I am.  Closely.  I need to know if he can be trusted. Alfred looks at other images- the D.A.at a meeting.

Who Rachel spends her time with is her business.

If you ever took one, I might.14. Alfred bites the thread.  Examines his stitches.  Looks at

Batman has no limits.

I can't afford to know them.

We all know how much you like to say 'I told you so'.

OK.  Cancel the deal.

I needed a closer look at their books.20.

I need a new suit.

I'm not talking about fashion, Mr.Fox, so much as function .

Sure make backing out of the driveway easier.

Rachel!  Fancy that.

Rachel, Natascha.  Natascha , Rachel.

I certainly hope not.

Let's put a couple tables together.

They should!  I own the place.

How'dyou know?

Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

You're into ballet, Harvey?

I was raised here.  I turned out OK.

The Palisades?  Sure.  You know, as our new D.A.you might want to figure out where your jurisdiction ends.

Well, you've sold me, Dent.  I'm gonnathrow you a fundraiser.

I don't think you understand.  One fundraiser with my pals, you'll never need another cent.

I'm sure you've always wanted to go to Hong Kong. Fox opens the door to a private elevator.

I think Mr.Laudeserves a more personal touch.

How about getting back into the plane?

Without it landing.

Sorry. Fox picks up the chest, demonstrating its flexibility.

We wouldn't want things getting too easy, would we? (picks up suit) How will it hold up against dogs? Fox looks at him quizzically.

South Korean smugglers.  They run flights into Pyongyang, below radar the whole way.  Did you think of an alibi? Alfred looks quite pleased with himself.

You look tired, Alfred.  Will you be all right without me? A Ballerina rolls over- waves the suntan lotion at Alfred.32.

How's the view from L.S.I.Holdings?36.

What's this?

(smiles) Sonar.  Just like a b-

And the other device?

How's it going?

And why do you think I wanted to hold a party for Harvey Dent?

Very droll.  But very wrong.

Sorry, I'm late- glad you started without me!  Where's Rachel?!

Rachel Dawes-my oldest friend.  When she told me she was dating Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say...  the guy from those god-awful campaign commercials? Laughter.  Dent shifts, embarrassed.

'I Believe in Harvey Dent.'  Nice slogan, Harvey.  Certainly caught Rachel's attention.  But then I started paying attention to Harvey, and all he's been doing as our new

(shakes his head) I meant every word.

The day you once told me about, the day when Gothamno longer needs Batman.  It's coming.

It's happening now- Harvey is that hero.  He locked up half the city's criminals, and he did it without wearing a mask.  Gothamneeds a hero with a face.

They've come for him.

Stay hidden.

Targeting me won't get their money back.  I knew the mob wouldn't go down without a fight, but this is different.  They've crossed a line.56.

Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred. We just have to figure out what he's after.

What were you missing?

So why was he stealing them?

Yes.  Government telecommunications project.

Lucius.I'm playing this one pretty close to the chest.

I've run it through all the databases and came up with four possibles.

Cross-reference the addresses. Look for Parkside and around.

Overlooking the parade.

I have no choice.

Perhaps not.  But I've got enough blood on my hands.  I've seen, now, what I would have to become to stop men like him.

You once told me that if the day came when I was finished...

We'd be together.

But did you mean it?

Anything that could lead back to Luciusor Rachel.

People are dying, Alfred.  What would you have me do?

Today I've found out what Batman can't do.  He can't endure this. (ruefulsmile) Today you get to say 'I told you so'.

Accomplice?  I'm going to tell them the whole thing was your idea. They power down, leaving the Bat-bunker in darkness.70.

Alfred?

Did I bring this on us?  On her?  I thought I would inspire good, not madness-

But Rachel, Alfred...

Gothamneeds its hero.  And I let the Joker blow him half to hell-

She was going to wait for me.  Dent doesn't know.  He can never know... Alfred glances at the envelope.  Takes it off the tray.

What's that?

That bandit, in the forest in Burma...  Did you catch him? (Alfred nods) How?

I need you plugged in, checking Gordon's men and their families.

Hospital admissions.

In the middle of the day?  Not very subtle, Alfred.

I saw O'Brien and Richards...

I saw Burns and Zachary... and a patrolman I don't know.

There's at least one I don't know- send the information to Gordon-

Call me Bruce.  I think so.

Trying to catch the light?

Why?  Who's in it?

(shrugs) It can get a little intense.  Think I should go to hospital?

That's why I gave it to you.  Only you can use it. Luciuslooks at Batman.  Hard.
