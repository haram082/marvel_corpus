No need, Okoye. I can handle this alone.

I will get Nakia out as quickly as possible .

What are you talking about? I never freeze.

Nakia ... I ... I wanted to ...

My father is dead , Nakia. The news devastates her .

I will be cro wned King tomorrow , and I wish for you to be there .

This never gets old .

Are you finished? Okoye slams her spear into the ground , signaling the rest of the Dora to follow her off .

So surprised my little sister came to see me off before our big day .

Update? No , it worked perfectly .

(teasing) You are teaching me, what do you know? 14.

I cannot wait to see what kind of update you make to your ceremonial outfit. Shuri flips him off .

How are you feeling today, mama?

(interrupting) I accept your challenge, M'Baku.

Yield! Don't make me kill you .

What would the proud Jabari do without you?

You have fought with honor , now yield! Your people need you . M'Baku looks up at the Jabari warriors .

Yield, man !

Zuri.

Wakanda forever !!

Baba!

I am sorry .

(in Xhosa) I am not ready, Baba.

That is not what I am talking about. I am not ready to be without you.

Never. (beat) Tell me how to best protect Wakanda. I want to be a great King, Baba . Just like you.

He was there! He was there. My father.

Corne home , Nakia.

Stay.

What would you have Wakanda do about it? Nakia thinks for a bit .

We are not like these other countries, Nakia. If the world found out what we truly are, and what we possess -- we could lose our way of life.

If you were not so stubborn you would make such a great queen.

Ah! So you admit it !

Is that him? Glory to Bast, man, is he still growing? W'Kabi laughs .

Nakia thinks we should be doing more.

Foreign aid ... refugee programs. W'Kabi shakes his head.

But waging war on other countries has never been our way. Then, both of their Kimoyo beads buzz.

You too, huh?

Klaue has escaped our pursuits for almost 30 years. Not capturing him was perhaps my father's greatest regret. I wish to bring Klaue back here to stand trial .

I need you here protecting the border.

You have my word I will bring him back. (beat) We will proceed with the mission . Ramonda looks on , irresolute .

Stop it. Stop it. Shuri laughs and they do a special handshake before walking down the spiral walkway into her sprawling, futuristic lab.

Okoye. And Nakia as well. Shuri makes a face at Nakia .

Yes. We'll be fine . (beat) Besides , you will be on call , should we need backup. Shuri smiles at this and points o ut small communications devices .

And what are these?

What, you don't like my royal sandals? I wanted to go old school for my first day .

Interesting •.•

Old ... ? Functional, but old . Eh, people are shooting at me ... wait let me put on my helmet .. .

Enough ... 35.

Tempting . But the idea is to not be noticed . This one .

Anywhere?

You told me to strike it, you didn't say how hard . Shuri picks the mannequin back up and drags it over to the same spot .

Well maybe you should make it a little stronger , eh? 37. Shuri shrugs as we see Wakandan Script built into the suit

Wait a minute .

Very nice.

You are recording?

Delete that footage ...

Spread out. The buyer is likely already here.

The woman outside --what trouble was she referring to? She plays along, alluring .

And will there be any trouble tonight, Ms . Kenyan heiress?

(into comm) Six. Just spotted an old friend who

Agent Ross .

You are buying from Klaue ...

I gave you Zemo .

Klaue is leaving out that door with me. You've been warned.

I am not here to make a deal . Ross rolls his eyes .

General .

And the vibranium.

Stand down . We can't afford a shoot­ out.

(in Xhosa) Murderer!

Shuri!

For Bast sake just drive!!!

Keep going! Panther uses his claws to make a sharp turn and avoid the wreck.

Don't worry about it . You're doing great. Panther leaps back onto the hood of the Lexus and they speed off.

Pull around the truck .

Faster, Shuri.

Klaue 11 Klaue slowly gets to his feet and tries to level his

Did you think we would forget !? Klaue laughs .

Look at me murderer ! Where did you get this weapon?

Every breath you take is mercy from me.

(in Xhosa) Better to let him talk to Klaue alone for 5 minutes than to make a

After your questioning , we will to take him back to Wakanda with us.

--Agent Ross .

I do appreciate your help in Busan .

Okoye! Play nice.

And you believe the word of an arms dealer, strapped to a chair. Ross hesitates , but doesn 't bite.

Give me a Kimoyo bead.

This will stabilize him for now.

Give him to us . We can save him.

I am well aware of my duties, General. I cannot just let him die knowing we can save him.

He's not here .

He slipped through our hands .

Leave us.

What happened to my Uncle N'Jobu? My father told me he disappeared ... there was a man today wearing a ring identical to this one .

He helped Klaue escape from us and he was wearing this ring . My grandfather 's ring. Do not tell me what is possible tell me the truth .

That is not your choice to make. What happened to him?

I am your King now ! Zuri looks up.

No .•.

No no no no no no ...

And the child ...

He killed his own brother ... and left a child behind with nothing . What kind of King •.. what kind of man does that?

He didn 't even give him a proper burial ... My Uncle N'Jobu betrayed us, but my father may have created something even worse .

Did he reveal anything about his identity?

(in Xhosa) Speak.

I don't care that you brought Klaue, the only reason I don't kill you where you stand is because I know who you are ... now what do you want?

And what tools are those?

Our our weapons will not be used to wage war on the world. It is not our way to be judge jury and executioner for people who are not our own .

I am not King of all people. I am King of Wakanda. And it is my responsibility to make sure our people are safe and that vibranium does not fall into the hands of a person like you. The elders murmur at Killmonger's disrespect. They wait to

No.

Take him away.

I accept your challenge.

This is your last chance, thro w down your weapons and we can handle this another way. Killmonger slams his blades into the stone .

Yield!

Nol Zuri no! Zuri!! Noo!

Why, Baba?

You were wrong to abandon him .

You were wrong ! All of you were wrong! To turn your backs on the rest of the world . We let the fear of our discovery stop us from doing what is right . No more! I cannot stay here with you. I cannot rest while he sits on the throne. He is a monster of our own making . I must take the mantle back , I must. I must right these wrongs . 97. T'Chaka looks at his son , his disappointment giving way to a proud smile .

Do you have a blanket?

Our resources . The Great Mound .

He will send our weapons all over the world .

(motioning to Shuri and Ramonda) You must get them out of Wakanda safely.

The challenge will have to continue .

It is my duty to keep you safe .

Could you give me and Lord M 'Baku a moment?

Thank you.

Please allow my mother to stay here.

You know I could use an army as well.

It is our cause . It is for all of us.

I cannot speak for past Kings . But an enemy sits on the throne right now. We both know the power of vibraniurn . If Killmonger gets control of it, who do you think he will come for next? M'Baku sits .

N'Jadakalll !

I never yielded, and as you can see, I am not dead .

(into comm) Shuri, now !

W'Kabi stop this ! Stop this now ! W'Kabi runs on top of a large rock to ga in a vantage point ,

Shuri I!

Shuri!

Turn on the train on the bottom track!

Neither will he.

You want to see us become just like the people you hate so much? Divide and conquer the land as they did?

You have become them . You will destroy the world, Wakanda included .

Maybe we can still heal you . Killmonger thinks on this .

Thank you. You saved me . You saved my family. Our nation.

You can't blame me I almost died. Nakia looks at him deeply, and kisses him back.

Stay. I think I know a way you can still fulfill your calling. Please stay. Nakia looks at T 'Challa with curious eyes. She kisses him .

This is where our father killed our uncle.

They're not tearing it down ... I bought this building. Shuri turns to him confused .

And that building , and that one over there ... This will be the first Wakandan International Outreach Center . Shuri smiles at the surprise.

Nakia will oversee the social outreach ... And you will spearhead the science and information exchange .
