A nightmare.

I fought them yesterday.

Can’t they kill me before breakfast?

You’re not the devil...

(indignant) Why?

I don’t need protection. The Guard points angrily at the unconscious prisoners.

I thought the point of solitary confinement was the solitary part.

Who are you?

I’ve heard the legends...master warrior, international mercenary, feared by all the underworld... some even swear he’s immortal.

Code? Aren’t you criminals?

And what am I looking for?

(weak) I need food.

(hoarse) Ra’s Al Ghul?

Ready? I... I can barely-

My anger outweighs my guilt. Ducard opens a door...

As weapons?

The man had a gun!

I’ve had training-

Beyond saving? You believe that? Ducard regards the harshly beautiful landscape.

Yield. Ducard smiles. Shakes his head.

To lose myself. I couldn’t do

How long?

(nods) I needed to understand the thoughts and feelings of those who stand in the shadows...

The first time you’re forced to steal not to starve...

...you lose many assumptions about the simple nature of right and wrong. Bruce hands the Child the plum. Licks his fingers. Hard.

I needed to feel the fear before a crime...

I thought I would find something...

I thought I would learn what I needed to do with my skills and my anger...

But the harder I looked the less I saw. The less I knew... Bruce turns to the Boss wary.

Until I wasn’t even sure what I’d been looking for in the first place...

And I was lost. Bruce sits in a line of criminals, hands cuffed behind back.

Why The masks?

I haven’t.

Where will I be leading these men?

You want me to go back to Gotham?

For what?

What?!

You can’t believe in this.

What’s necessary.

Tell him... I have an ailing ancestor who needs me.

(hoarse) Alfred. (2) 42.

Yes. Yes it has. I need a ride.

Bhutan, I think.

I’m traveling a bit light, yes.

Very good. Oh, and Alfred?

Bring some painkillers.

Have you told anyone I’m coming home? (2) 43.

No one can know I’m back. Not until I’m ready. I’ll need everything on the company- shareholders’ reports, holdings. Everything.

Gotham needs me, Alfred. Gotham needs... a symbol.

I’m not sure. Something for the good to rally behind...

...and the criminals to fear.

Is it closed?

(low) Respect?

Morning. The Assistant gets to her feet.

Yes, I can.

Sorry to barge in, but I was in the areas... (2) 47.

What can I say? "Reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated".

(mischievous) You can ask...

Applied sciences caught my eye.

No, let’s go. Alfred pulls out with a touch of disappointment.

None?

They didn’t tell me anything.

You were on the board?

You knew my father?

Bullet-proof?

Tear-resistant?

Why didn’t they put it into production?

I want to borrow it. For spelunking. (off look) You know, cave-diving. Fox shrugs. Puts the lid back on the crate. (3) 51.

(smiles) Listen, I’d rather Mr.Earle didn’t know about me borrowing-

Okay! Give it a try.

(awe) Alfred, come up here. Alfred is twenty feet behind on the dry rocks.

Don’t turn around.

I’ve been watching. You’re a good cop. One of the few. What would it take to get Falcone? Gordon narrows his eyes, puzzled.

He brings in shipments of drugs every week, nobody takes him down. Why?

What would it take?

Rachel Dodson in the D.A.’s office.

Watch for a sign.

Now we are two.

Keep your elbows in...

(conspiratorial) I thought a few promotions might be good karma forgetting my new job. Earle smiles patiently.

(grins) Three month’s time- I’m having a huge blowout and I expect everyone to be there.

Great- there’s some cool stuff down there. Although that Mr.Fox goes on a bit once you get him talking.

Business... sure.

Offering shares?

Right, who’s turn is it?

Via a shell corporation.

(nods) Put it together ourselves. (2) 59.

How large?

(smiles) Least we’ll have spares.

Sper -lunking. And no, today it’s base-jumping.

I need some kind of lightweight grappling hook...

Base jumping’s illegal-you can’t just take the elevator.

Any good? (2) 60.

Too expensive for the army?

Look, Mr.Fox, if you’re uncomfortable-

(nods) Fair enough.

What kind of shapes can you make? Fox releases the tent,

What’s that ? Fox, a twinkle in his eye, rolls up the memory fabric.

Does it come in black?

At least they gave us a discount.

A man, however strong, however skilled, is just flesh and blood. I need to be more than a man. I need to be a symbol.

Bats frighten me. (slight smile) And it’s time my enemies shared my dread.

(groggy) Bats are nocturnal.

Theatricality and deception are powerful weapons, Alfred. It’s a start.

I’m not learning polo, Alfred.

What does someone like me do?

A guy who dresses up like a bat clearly has issues .

If he’s so benevolent why does he hide his face?

Well, they’re European. (2) 81.

(turns to Earle) Mr.Earle, I’m buying this hotel. Will you please broker a deal? Earle nods. Patiently.

Ladies?

Rachel.

Oh, kind of all over, you know.

You didn’t?

Rachel, all that... that’s not me, inside I’m... different. I’m-

(hoarse) How long did I sleep?

It was some kind of gas... I only breathed the slightest amount... (2) 89.

I’ve felt those effects before... but this was much more potent .

It’s some kind of weaponized hallucinogen. Administered in aerosol form.

Could you synthesize an antidote?

(reaches for paper) So you can’t.

What?

Could you find out?

I’m sorry, I’ll come back.

I’m sorry, have we..?

I wanted to invite you a party-

Today’s my birthday. And I wanted to apologize.

I thought you could never quite give up on me.

I hate the place. I’d tear it down if I could. (4) 93.

The place is nothing without the people who made it what it was. Now there’s only Alfred.

You’re going to Arkham now? It’s in the Narrows, Rachel. Rachel gives him a look.

Keep them happy until I arrive. Tell them that joke you know.

Rachel’s sedated. You can take her home. (2) 119.

Is Fox still here? (Alfred nods) Tell your staff to stop serving drinks and move everybody on after the cake.

Any word on that... item . Fox nods, glances around. Leans in, conspiratorial. (2) 120.

Could you sue it to put a biological agent into the air?

Mr.Earle, good of you to come.

Who was buying?

Have you met Lucius Fox? (3) 121.

Fox is showing me the ropes down at Applied Sciences... he’s a great untapped resource at our company, aren’t you, Mr.Fox?

Mrs. Delane, I can’t just now...

You’re not Ra’s Al Ghul. He’s dead. The Society Dame laughs nervously, confused.

(understanding) Or cheap parlor tricks to conceal your trues identity.., Ra’s ?

Your quarrel is with me. Let these people go.

Crane was working for you.

You’re going to unleash Crane’s poison on the entire city...

You’re going to destroy millions of lives.

You’re inhuman.

What part was that, Ra’s? To put my company at your disposal? To obtain your microwave emitter and plant it somewhere in Gotham?

You underestimate Gotham.

To kill me?

To take power .

I will not take life. I will not be a part of this.

I frighten criminals .

Perhaps you taught me too well.

(whispers) What have I done, Alfred? Everything my family... everything my Father and his father built... Alfred struggles to pull himself to a standing position.

I thought I could... help Gotham... but I’ve failed... Alfred makes a futile show of dusting down his jacket.

Still haven’t given up on me? Alfred offers him a trembling hand.

It is mycompany.

And I bought most of the shares. A

Look, it’s all a bit technical, but the important thing is.... my company’s future is secure.

Do you remember the day I fell?

As I lay there, I knew ... I could sense it...

That things would never be the same.

Childhood’s end.

True things. You made me see that justice is about more than my own pain and anger.

About what?

Rachel, this life I chose... I can give it up. Rachel reaches up to his face with her hand.

I’m going to rebuild it just the way it was. Brick for brick.

Yes, why? They stroll, side by side, towards the smoking ruins.

In the south east corner?
